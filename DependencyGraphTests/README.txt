# Comments to Evaluators:

The DependencyGraphTests program is currently capable of testing all methods of the 
DependencyGraph class with 100% coverage, as well as most edge cases.
No errors are tested since no errors are thrown by DependencyGraph, and cases which include
inputting null values are currently not tested for due to recommendation from Piazza TA's.
No future extensions are planned on this document until DependencyGraph undergoes more development,
perhaps to deal with that whole null values scenario.

# Assignment Specific Topics

None.

# Consulted Peers:

Kelly / Kelley?
	I don't know his contact info or name spelling, sorry! He sits in the front row of lectures with me.
	We discussed things about DependencyGraph, though nothing specific about the testing.
	I figured I'd put him here just in case, see that README for more details.
