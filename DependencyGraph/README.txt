# Comments to Evaluators:

This library is a reference for future programs that will
need the ability to track, graph, traverse, and otherwise analyze nodes
which depend on eachother. It's a very bare-bones dependency graph!
Currently, it can track directly connected nodes in a graph through dependencies
wherein one node is the dependent and one is the dependee, and feed the user
basic data regarding the graph and nodes that exist.
Github is updated from last week's fiasco.

# Consulted Peers:

Kelly / Kelley?
	I don't know his contact info or name spelling, sorry! He sits in the front row of lectures with me.
	We discussed what structure types we use/planned to use. We were in agreement about mirrored dictionaries (I think),
	but he gave me the idea to use HashTables as they do not allow duplicates. This was on Tuesday, a few days before I could start coding.
	I adapted this idea into HashSets instead.
