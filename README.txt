# Overview of the Spreadsheet functionality

The Spreadsheet program is currently capable of evaluating an expression based on the algorithm given in the assignment doc.
It can also seperately track, remember, and alter nodes in a graph which are dependent on each other.
Future extensions are allowing for graph traversal, combining the two assignments to allow for node-dependent calculation,
and then implementing this to a Spreadsheet GUI, I imagine!

# Time Expenditures:

HOURS EST  / ACTUAL      SOLUTION                       NOTES

------  12 / 20     ASSIGNMENT 1
        8  / 15          FormulaEvaluator               I am very rusty. I took 2420 a year ago, and no coding classes since. Yikers. Also, switching to C#.
        3  / 6           FormulaEvaluatorTester         ^^ I was very detailed with my tests. It was mainly keeping up with documetation and recall times that took so long...
                                                        I also had GitHub troubles that took about 2 hours.
------  15 / 11.5   ASSIGNMENT 2
        7  / 6          DependencyGraph                 Due to last time's crazy underestimate, I estimated much higher, though I felt more prepared about this assignment.   
        8  / 3          DependencyGraphTester           ^^ This time, my ADHD also kicked in pretty dang hard, so I had to reread and rewrite 3x as much as I feel I normally would have.
        0  / 2.5        (Tech troubles :/ )             2.5 hours were lost this time to infuriating debug issues. Had to completely redownload VSC2022 and it didn't help...
