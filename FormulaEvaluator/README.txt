# Comments to Evaluators:

The Spreadsheet program is currently capable of evaluating an expression based on the algorithm given in the assignment doc.
Future extensions are implementing this to a Spreadsheet GUI and allowing for graphing, I imagine!
Perhaps I will find ways to handle overflow or take in other operations, too!

# Assignment Specific Topics

None.


# Consulted Peers:

None. I did not have any time this week to talk to other CS friends besides during lab, and we were very busy figuring out GitHub.
Making friends is scary :,)
