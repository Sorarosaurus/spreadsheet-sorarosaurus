# Comments to Evaluators:

The FormulaEvaluator program is currently capable of evaluating an expression based on the algorithm given in the assignment doc.
Future extensions are implementing this to a Spreadsheet GUI and allowing for graphing, I imagine!
Perhaps I will find ways to handle overflow or take in other operations, too!

# Assignment Specific Topics

None.


# Consulted Peers:

None. I did not have any time the week this was developed to talk to other CS friends besides during lab, and we were very busy figuring out GitHub.
Making friends is scary :,)
