# Comments to Evaluators:

The FormulaEvaluatorTester program is currently capable of testing all basic operations.
Something odd happened when I reformatted my tests using XML documentation. They were completely functional and all passed,
but the bottom methods aren't recognized by the program as methods? I commented them out.
No future extensions are planned on this document (besides that bug fix) unless FormulaEvaluator undergoes more development,
perhaps to stop overflow or take in other operations.

# Assignment Specific Topics

None.


# Consulted Peers:

None. I did not have any time the week this was developed to talk to other CS friends besides during lab, and we were very busy figuring out GitHub.
Making friends is scary :,)
